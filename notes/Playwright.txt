# ACTIVATE VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT
# PowerShell:

## DIFFERENCE: Playwright vs. Pytest-Playwright

# Playwright:
- Installed via: pip install playwright
- Provides the core Playwright API
- Used for browser automation and API testing
- Does NOT include pytest integration

# Pytest-Playwright:
- Installed via: pip install pytest-playwright
- Extends Playwright with pytest features (fixtures, CLI support)
- Allows writing tests using pytest structure
- Provides built-in fixtures like "page" and "browser" (no manual launch needed)
- Tests are executed with the pytest command

# You can safely install both together (no conflicts)
# To view details about the installation:
pip show pytest-playwright

------------------------------------------------------------

## RUNNING TESTS WITH PYTEST
# Test file names must start with "test_"
pytest test_sample.py              # Run a specific test file
pytest                             # Run all tests in the current directory
