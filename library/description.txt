This folder contains libraries used in the test automation framework, excluding SeleniumLibrary.

It includes both globally maintained libraries (shared across multiple projects) and those developed specifically for this project. The libraries in this folder provide additional functionality, integration points, and support for custom automation needs.

Contributors should refer to this folder to:
- Find custom or third-party libraries (other than SeleniumLibrary)
- Identify whether each library is global or project-specific
- Review documentation and configuration requirements for each library

Maintaining this folder ensures clarity and organization for all contributors working with the test automation codebase.
